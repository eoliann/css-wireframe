# css-wireframe
A tiny css file who is designed to offer an API directly in HTML file.

This css file is written in functional css style, in other words contains only specific individual tasks.

Is very simple to use, for example if we want to center an h1 tag inside a div tag, we should proceed as follows:
```html
<div class="flex-center">
  <h1>flex-center is a class from css-wireframe</h1>
</div>
```
